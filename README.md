Evolutionary Computation Library Yielding Python Science and Engineering

This is a library for doing Evolutionary Computation (EC) in Python.
If you're not sure what evolutionary computation is, it's the field of AI which
includes Genetic Algorithms.  There are several other forms of EC, including
Genetic Programming (GP), Evolution Strategies (ES) and Evolutionary Programming (EP).

I developed the basic outline and structure of this library while I was working
on my PhD dissertation.  I was very happy with the design decisions that I had made
and the flexibility that they offered me, so I've decided to share it with other.

I plan on bringing more pieces of that library here as I update it and make it
more user friendly.
